Requirements:
1. Windows OS.
2. Python 3.8.10 can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/.

Setting up:
1. Copy all files in the folder and paste it into the folder containing your minecraft server
   (directory must contain the script to run your server). This script is usually a .bat
   file but can come in the form of a .sh file. Note that the remote server script does
   not work with .sh files without modification.
2. Run the start.bat file and make sure a data folder with privatekey.txt inside is generated.
3. Pass this data folder to any user that you would like to give the privilege of turning
   ON/OFF the Minecraft server.



Description of functionality:

start.bat    - Remotely turns on the Minecraft remote server, server side script. Ensure that
               your Minecraft server is off before running the script.



Note:
1. If a new key is required, delete the data folder and run start.bat.
2. Currently, injection of server commands is not supported.
